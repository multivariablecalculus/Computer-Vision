All files kept here are WIP and do contain bugs, you can clone this repo or you can copy the code but I advice to exercise caution and proper debugging before execution;

This Repo mainly contains OpenCV codes and AI Computer Vision digitals, so you may use Tensorflow as well, but Keras might depend on your liking.
